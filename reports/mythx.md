- **Issue:** SWC-134 - Message call with hardcoded gas amount
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The highlighted function call forwards a fixed amount of gas. This is discouraged as the gas cost of EVM instructions may change in the future, which could break this contract&#39;s assumptions. If this was done to prevent reentrancy attacks, consider alternative methods such as the checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy locks instead.

- **Issue:** SWC-100 - Function Default Visibility
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The function definition of &#34;null&#34; lacks a visibility specifier. Note that the compiler assumes &#34;public&#34; visibility by default. Function visibility should always be specified explicitly to assure correctness of the code and improve readability.

- **Issue:** SWC-116 - Timestamp Dependence
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The block.timestamp environment variable is used to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don&#39;t use any of those environment variables as sources of randomness and be aware that use of these variables introduces a certain level of trust into miners.
- **Line:** 148
```
    require (block.timestamp &lt; endTime, &#34;Market closed.&#34;);
```
